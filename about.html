                    <p>Creativity is at the heart of every dream. Every idea, every groundbreaking leap that changes our world starts with the
                    vision of talented creators. At DJI, we give these creators the tools they need to bring their ideas to life.</p>
                    <p>Our platforms empower them to capture images that were once out of reach. Our flying and camera stabilization systems
                    redefine camera placement and motion. Amazing photos and video, treasured personal memories, and high-end professional
                    imagery are captured every day, in every corner of the world using DJI products.</p>
                    <p>We do this through an unparalleled commitment to R&D, a culture of constant innovation and curiosity, and a focus on
                    transforming complex technology into easy-to-use devices. Building on the ethos of “form follows function,” our products
                    combine advanced technology with dynamic designs.</p>
                    <p>Headquartered in Shenzhen, widely considered China’s Silicon Valley, DJI benefits from direct access to the suppliers,
                    raw materials, and young, creative talent pool necessary for sustained success. Drawing on these resources, we have
                    grown from a single small office in 2006 to a global workforce. Our offices can now be found in the United States,
                    Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. As a privately owned and operated
                    company, DJI focuses on our own vision, supporting creative, commercial, and nonprofit applications of our technology.
                    Today, DJI products are redefining industries. Professionals in filmmaking, agriculture, conservation, search and
                    rescue, energy infrastructure, and more trust DJI to bring new perspectives to their work and help them accomplish feats
                    safer, faster, and with greater efficiency than ever before.</p>
